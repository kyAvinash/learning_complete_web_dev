    <p> This is Paragraph 1 for testing </p>
    <p> This is Paragraph 2 for testing </p>

    <!-- Here its automatically inserting line after every new paragraph 
    
    Now we will test with <span> tag.
    -->

    <span> This is 1st Span </span>
    <span> This is 2nd Span </span>

    <!-- Here span will not change new line at the end of every span tag. So if 
        we don't want to change the line after paragraph we can use  the span.
    -->


    <!-- Here we can't understand the difference between the <p> tag and <span> tag
        Just we can play with both tags to understand better.    
    -->

    <p style="border:2px solid red;"> This is Paragraph 3 for understand the difference. </p>
    <p style="border:2px solid blue;"> This is Paragraph 4 for understand the difference. </p>


    <!-- now just apply same style for span tag -->

    <span style="border:2px solid red;"> This is Span 3 for understand the difference </span>
    <span style="border:2px solid blue;"> This is Span 4 for understand the difference </span>

    <!-- Now here in output we can absorb the difference between paragraph <p> tag and <span> tag 
        <p> paragraph tag will take full (complete line and we can use that).
            But <span> only taking own space equals to number of characters present in tag.
                Just closly obsorb in output.
                
        that's why <span tag is Inline tag.
        and <p> is block element.

        <span> tag is an inline element
        li ->       <li> tag is neither an inline nor a block-level element. 
                    <li> tag is used to represent an individual item in an ordered list 
                    (<ol>) or an unordered list (<ul>). Lists can contain multiple list items, 
                    and each list item represents a single entry or point in the list.
                    When used inside an ordered or unordered list, the <li> tag automatically 
                    creates a new list item for each element and formats them accordingly. 
                    List items are displayed consecutively, one after the other, and they 
                    can contain various types of content, such as text, images, or other HTML elements.
        
        em ->       The <em> tag is an inline element

        div->       The <div> tag is a block-level element
        img->       The <img> tag is an inline element
