    <!-- for now just assume that class redBG is already defined.
        Leter in css we learned about how to defne that class.

        When we create class of redBG and define Property of that class. than If 
        we give all the property inside this redBG. if we give this redBG to any 
        element than that element acquire all the property of redBG class. 
        
        mainly . (dot) is used for class
        and # (hash) is used for id
    -->
